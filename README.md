# GA Project 1 - Top 5 Movies
I am a big movie buff. So when we were asked to pick an API for Project 1, I naturally gravitated towards the movies API. I built a very simple application that generates a list of 5 random movies from the [OMDB API]('http://omdbapi.com/). The movies are displayed as tiles/cards on the main screen. The user can then click the movie card to bring up an overlay with additional details about the movie.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
    - CSS Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
- Javascript
- jQuery
- OMBD API
- IFRAME
- AJAX

## Wireframes 
These were the wireframes I created before starting to write any code for this project. The actual style and layout ended up a bit different, especially on the overlay for Movie Details

## Future Enhancements
- Give the user the option to select a Genre, and only return results for that Genre from the API
- Embed movie trailers to the Movie Details overlay. May have to hit another API to return trailers for a given movie, since OMDB API doesn't return trailers.
