# GA Project 1 - Top 5 Movies
I am a big movie buff. So when we were asked to pick an API for Project 1, I naturally gravitated towards the movies API. I built a very simple application that generates a list of 5 random movies from the [OMDB API]('http://omdbapi.com/). The movies are displayed as tiles/cards on the main screen. The user can then click the movie card to bring up an overlay with additional details about the movie. 


## Technologies Used

    - CSS Flexbox

## Wireframes 
These were the wireframes I created before starting to write any code for this project. The actual style and layout ended up a bit different, especially on the overlay for Movie Details
